I developed an advanced Power BI dashboard for Blinkit, an online grocery delivery platform,
to deliver actionable insights that drive operational efficiency and enhance customer satisfaction.
The dashboard offers a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit's key metrics, enabling strategic decision-making through intuitive and impactful visualizations.  

**Key insights visualized:**  
- **Total Sales:** Tracking overall revenue trends to evaluate performance.  
- **Average Sales:** Identifying transaction patterns to understand typical customer spending.  
- **Number of Items Sold:** Monitoring product movement to ensure optimal stock levels.  
- **Average Customer Rating:** Assessing customer satisfaction and identifying areas for improvement.  
- **Outlet Locations:** Mapping geographical performance to reveal regional strengths and opportunities.  
- **Outlet Size:** Analyzing the impact of store dimensions on sales efficiency.  

This project not only provided Blinkit with a holistic view of their operations but also empowered them to
optimize inventory, enhance delivery routes, and improve customer experience, ultimately driving sales growth.
